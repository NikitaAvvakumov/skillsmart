This application was written as part of a job application. It has many known
rough edges.

An Expert can specify in which skills s/he is proficient. A Customer can then
search for experts with particular skills, including multiple skills from a
given service area.

_Note: running `rake db:seed`, `rake db:setup` or `rake db:reset` will seed the
database with 8 services with 13 skills each, 1000 customers and 1000 experts,
and will then assign 3 skills to each expert. Currently, **this will happen in
production** as well._
